- TTS charged by character count, not tokens

---

## Cost Breakdown per Query

### Typical Query Flow

```
User Voice Input (10s) → Whisper STT → Embedding → RAG Retrieval
→ GPT-4o-mini Generation → TTS-1-HD → Audio Response
```

### Before Optimization (Baseline)

#### Query Components

```
1. Voice Transcription (Google Cloud Speech)
   - Duration: 10 seconds
   - Cost: $0.024 per minute / 6 = $0.004

2. Query Embedding (OpenAI)
   - Tokens: ~150 tokens (Arabic query)
   - Cost: 150 / 1,000,000 × $0.130 = $0.0000195

3. RAG Retrieval (Database)
   - Cost: Negligible (self-hosted PostgreSQL)
   - Cost: ~$0.0001 (amortized server cost)

4. Answer Generation (GPT-4o-mini)
   - Input: ~800 tokens (context + query)
   - Output: ~400 tokens (answer)
   - Input cost: 800 / 1,000,000 × $0.150 = $0.00012
   - Output cost: 400 / 1,000,000 × $0.600 = $0.00024
   - Total: $0.00036

5. Voice Synthesis (Google Cloud TTS)
   - Characters: ~200 characters
   - Cost: 200 / 1,000,000 × $16 (WaveNet) = $0.0032

Total per query (before): $0.0114
```

### After Optimization (Current)

#### Optimization Techniques Applied

1. ✅ Migrated to OpenAI Whisper (30% cheaper + better quality)
2. ✅ Audio optimization (70% file size reduction)
3. ✅ Embedding caching (40% hit rate)
4. ✅ TTS caching (35% hit rate)
5. ✅ Response streaming (better UX, same cost)
6. ✅ Similarity threshold increase (fewer low-quality matches)

#### Optimized Query Cost

```

3. RAG Retrieval (Database)
   - Cost: ~$0.0001 (unchanged)

4. Answer Generation (GPT-4o-mini)
   - Input: ~600 tokens (better retrieval = less context)
   - Output: ~350 tokens (more concise prompts)
   - Input cost: 600 / 1,000,000 × $0.150 = $0.00009
   - Output cost: 350 / 1,000,000 × $0.600 = $0.00021
   - Total: $0.00030

5. Voice Synthesis (OpenAI TTS-1-HD) with 35% cache hit rate
   - Characters: ~200 characters
   - Cache hit: 35% → 0 cost
