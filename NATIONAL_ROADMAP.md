## 🎯 CRITICAL MISSING PIECES (Priority Order)

### 1. **ACTUAL LEGAL CONTENT** ⚖️ (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Status: ⚠️ Only 3 sample documents**

**What's Needed:**
- [ ] **Complete Legal Database** (Minimum 100+ documents)
  - All 12 legal domains fully covered
  - Full text of major Moroccan codes:
    - Code Pénal (القانون الجنائي) - Complete
    - Moudawana (مدونة الأسرة) - All 400 articles
    - Code du Travail (مدونة الشغل) - Complete
    - Code de Commerce - Complete
    - Code Civil (قانون الالتزامات والعقود) - Complete
  - Recent laws (2020-2025)
  - Bulletin Officiel archives

**How to Get It:**
1. **Scrape from official sources:**
   - https://www.sgg.gov.ma (Secrétariat Général du Gouvernement)
   - https://www.justice.gov.ma
   - Bulletin Officiel digital archives
   
2. **Partner with legal institutions:**
   - Ministry of Justice
   - Bar associations (Ordre des Avocats)
   - Law schools (Faculté de Droit)
   
3. **Manual digitization:**
   - Hire law students to transcribe

   - Crowdsource from lawyers

**Impact:** 🔥 **THIS IS THE #1 BLOCKER**
- Without real legal content, answers are generic
- Users will lose trust quickly
- Media won't cover it seriously

---

### 2. **MOROCCAN DARIJA OPTIMIZATION** 🗣️
**Status: ⚠️ Works but not optimized**

**What's Needed:**
- [ ] **Darija-specific training data**
  - Common legal phrases in Darija
  - Moroccan legal slang dictionary
  - Whisper fine-tuning for Darija accent
  
- [ ] **Better prompts for Darija:**
  ```
  Examples:
  "شنو كايقول القانون" → Understand as "What does the law say"
  "واش عندي الحق" → "Do I have the right"
  "كيفاش ندير" → "How do I do"
  "شحال كنخلص" → "How much do I pay"
  ```

- [ ] **Darija response mode:**
  - Answer in colloquial Moroccan Arabic
  - Not formal MSA (feels foreign to Moroccans)
  - Legal terms in Darija when possible

**How to Implement:**
1. Create Darija legal phrase dictionary
2. Add to RAG prompts: "Answer in Moroccan Darija (الدارجة المغربية)"
3. Fine-tune Whisper on Moroccan Arabic samples
4. Test with real Moroccans from different regions

**Impact:** 🎯 **CRITICAL FOR MOROCCAN ADOPTION**
